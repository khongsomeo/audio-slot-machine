## About
This project started in 2018, inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/6fmq09/a_simple_graphical_volume_control/).

At that time, the author wanted to build a mini-game, for people who want to change their computer's sound volume in a more cooler way.

This repository is being re-built, thanks to __@khongsomeo/DT101__
